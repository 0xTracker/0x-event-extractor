> NodeJS worker originally built for [0x Tracker](https://0xtracker.com) which extracts [0x](https://0xproject.com) fill events from the Ethereum blockchain and persists them to MongoDB. Support for both V1 and V2 of the 0x protocol is included with events tagged against the protocol version they belong to.

## üßê How It Works

The extractor runs on a configurable interval, scraping a chunk of events from the blockchain using the `getLogsAsync` method of [0x.js](https://www.0xproject.com/docs/0x.js). Events are persisted to MongoDB and the scraped block range is also logged to ensure the same blocks don't get scraped twice.

Two versions of the extractor exist in separate branches; one for V1 of the 0x protocol (`master`) and one for V2 (`master-v2`). These branches will be reorganised once V2 is released on mainnet. Support for V1 may be removed in the future once the majority of events are being processed through V2 of the protocol.

## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Requirements

To run the project locally you'll need the following installed:

- NodeJS v8.11.4
- MongoDB

The project also has support for the following development tools which you may wish to take advantage of:

- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors)

## üê£ Getting Started

Run `cp .env.example .env` to create a local environment file, then get yourself an [Infura API key](https://infura.io/register) and add it to your .env file. Update the connection string as well if necessary.

Run `npm i` to install dependencies and then run `npm start`/`nodemon` to start the extractor. You should start to see events being persisted.

## üõ† Configuration

Configuration is handled by a combination of [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) files and [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config). If you need to tweak anything you can either edit your .env file or create a config/local.js file with overrides for the configuration found in config/default.js.
